This project reproduces the mechanics of Jump King using the Unity engine and integrates machine learning to clear each stage, following the methodology showcased in Code Bullet’s video [AI Learns to play JUMP KING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmQ4Dqxs0HI). The aim is to learn and replicate the processes in the video.
